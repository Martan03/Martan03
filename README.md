### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who enjoys programming in statically typed programming languages. I usualy work on small utilities that make my life better
or just fun things (fractals, loopover, ...). I'm also working on several C# libraries that can help anyone using that language.

You can visit my [website](https://martan03.github.io) to learn more about me.
